this is the implementation of my paper: extremely fast codebook learning for landmark recognition

Abstract:
Traditional landmark recognition methods work by using local image features, k-means vector quantization and classifiers like SVM to recognize landmarks. However, the inefficient codebook learning by k-means constraints the possibility of using high-dimensional feature spaces, large numbers of image descriptors and large codebooks which are needed for good results. In this paper we introduce a fast unsupervised codebook learning - Extremely Random Projection Forest (ERPF), which is an ensemble of random projection tree with randomly splitting direction. We evaluate our approach on two public datasets and ERPF significantly outperforms other spatial tree methods and k-means.
